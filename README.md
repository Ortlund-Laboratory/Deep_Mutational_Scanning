#  Welcome to the Deep Mutational Repo

Thanks for stopping by but you really should be [looking at the Wiki](https://github.com/steviep42/Deep_Mutational_Scanning/wiki) associated with this repository since it details information associated with experiments with the ECNet software which is "An evolutionary context-integrated deep learning framework for protein engineering".
